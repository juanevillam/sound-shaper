# Sound Shaper

Third portfolio app: a **PERSONAL** music player + tweaker — zero social
features, by design (2026-07-18): every upload is for the uploader alone, which
keeps the copyright surface at zero. Upload your own `.mp3`s, read their tags,
play them, shape the sound. Same engineering mentality as Topper — native UI
per platform, shared portfolio Welcome / Settings / Manage-account screens,
full Firebase (Spark), no self-hosted backend.

**No tabs, no playlists.** Home is the single root screen: a 2-column grid of
SONG tiles (cover art + title/artist) plus an Add-song tile — you upload a
song and it's just there (flat library at `users/{uid}/songs`, newest first;
playlists were dropped 2026-07-19). The player is NOT a route: a bottom banner
that expands in place (PlayerSheet). There is NO Explore and NO profile
screen. Don't reintroduce social affordances (visibility toggles, feeds,
follows) or playlists — simplicity is the point.

**Where Settings and Account live (iOS, 2026-08-20).** Home's bar carries TWO
trailing glyphs in one merged Liquid Glass pill — Account, then Settings — and
both present as full-height native FORM SHEETS, with Trophies stacking over
Account. That is the portfolio-wide placement, matching Topper and
expo-ui-starter; the route table and the reasoning are in `lib/sheetRoutes.ts`
(`IOS_SHEET_SCREENS`). Account is the identity surface here, the way the
Profile header is in Topper — a personal app has no profile tab for it to hang
off. ANDROID IS UNCHANGED: there these are ordinary pushed Material screens and
Trophies stays a row in Settings.

**Home's iOS header is the SYSTEM large title**, not the shared
`CollapsingHeaderBar` (Android still uses that). The one thing it costs is
spelled out in `home.tsx`: the bar EMPTIES while the player is expanded rather
than hiding, because hiding it re-lays-out the screen and drops the player 8.67pt.

**The dev state lab is on** (`src/dev/flags.ts` → `STATE_LAB`). It pins home,
the account sheet and trophies to any of their UI states; the picker is the
shared `StateLab`. While it is on, the real account deletion is REFUSED
(`dev/deleteAccountGuard`) — turn the flag off to delete for real. THERE ARE NO
FIXTURES and none are to be added.

**The build plan is the source of truth:**
[`../../docs/sound-shaper-plan.md`](../../docs/sound-shaper-plan.md) — scope,
data model, phases, and the copyright rule (owner hears the full song, the
public feed plays only the clip preview).

## Status

**Flat-library phase — Android-first.** Auth (Google/Apple), song upload
(document-picker → ID3 parse `src/lib/id3.ts` → `EditSongSheet` →
**Cloudinary** audio as a `video` resource + embedded art → Firestore at
`users/{uid}/songs`), the song-tile home grid, and the expanding PlayerSheet
(audio-api playback through the EQ graph, Shape/Clips pages) are all built and
device-verified. Long-press a tile edits/deletes; tapping plays and opens the
player.

**No Firebase Storage, no Cloud Functions** — both need the Blaze (paid) plan,
and this app stays on Spark (free). Media goes to **Cloudinary** (same cloud
`juanevillam` as Topper, unsigned preset `sound_shaper_unsigned`,
`src/services/cloudinary/`). Consequence: Cloudinary deletion needs a signed
backend call we don't have, so deleting a song/playlist orphans its Cloudinary
assets (a known gap, exactly Topper's pre-Functions state).

Playback runs on **react-native-audio-api** (expo-audio is gone from the
player): a streaming `<Audio>` element routed through a Web-Audio shaping
graph — preamp + 5 biquad EQ bands (`src/lib/audioEngine.ts`,
`src/components/player/AudioEngine.tsx`, shaper settings in
`src/store/shaper.ts`) — with speed presets 0.5–2×, keep-pitch, clips
(personal replay bookmarks), and background playback via the plugin's media
foreground service.

Deliberate gaps, in build order: lock-screen now-playing metadata, and
Cloudinary media on account deletion (the audio and artwork orphan — deleting
them needs a signed backend call this app doesn't have, the same accepted gap as
deleting a single song).

**Account deletion is `hooks/useDeleteAccount` on iOS** — re-auth FIRST, then the
Firestore sweep, then the Apple token revoke, then the Auth user. Android calls
the combined `deleteAccount` and has no re-auth. Its sweep silently deleted no
songs or clips until 2026-08-20 (wrong collection paths that were still legal
paths); the refs now mirror `songs.ts` / `clips.ts` exactly, and any new
subcollection has to be added there or a recreated account inherits it.

Brand is deliberately **deferred to the end** — the launcher icon / splash /
welcome hero currently use **placeholder art borrowed from expo-ui-starter**; the
Welcome hero falls back to the app initial (no `logo` prop yet). Replace with a
real stroke glyph (48-grid, stroke 3.25, sibling to the Topper crown) at the
brand phase.

## Expo has changed

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before
writing native code. `@expo/ui` (Jetpack Compose + SwiftUI) markdown snapshots
live in `../expo-ui-starter/docs/`. The installed TypeScript types under
`node_modules/@expo/ui` are the source of truth when the docs disagree.

## Sign in with Apple is temporarily OFF (free-team dev)

`APPLE_SIGN_IN_ENABLED = false` in `src/app/(welcome)/welcome.tsx` hides the
button on iOS, so the welcome screen offers Google alone. The
`com.apple.developer.applesignin` entitlement needs a PAID Apple Developer
membership, which the free personal team can't sign — a button that can only
fail is worse than no button. The entitlement itself is stripped by
`ios.usesAppleSignIn: false` plus `plugins/with-strip-apple-signin.js`, which
must stay the **FIRST** entry in `app.json`'s `plugins` array (the entitlements
mod registered earliest runs last, so listing it later loses to
`expo-apple-authentication`). Revert all three together once the paid account
lands — App Store policy requires Apple sign-in wherever Google is offered.
Nothing was deleted: `useAppleSignIn.ios.ts`, `services/firebase/appleAuth.ts`
and `AppleSignInButton` stay wired and correct.

## iOS build recipe — same as Topper's, deliberately

`expo-build-properties` carries **only** `ios: { useFrameworks: "static" }`, and
`package.json` carries `expo.autolinking.apple.buildFromSource: ["ExpoImage"]`.
That pair dodges the precompiled-`ExpoModulesCore` ABI drift (source-build just
the one drifted pod) while keeping precompiled modules **on**, which is what
keeps `RNFBFirestore` compiling under `use_frameworks!`.

This app used to also set `usePrecompiledModules: false` +
`buildReactNativeFromSource: true`, which forced React Native itself to compile
from source — roughly 45 min per clean build instead of 15. That was written
before Topper's narrower fix had ever been proven, and was dropped 2026-07-30.
**Don't reintroduce it.** If a launch-time `dyld` abort ever comes back
(`Symbol not found: …_decorateModule…`), the fix is to add the offending module
to `buildFromSource`, not to turn precompiled modules off globally — verify
statically with `nm -u` per module against `nm -gU` on `ExpoModulesCore`, on
both the `ios-arm64` and `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator` slices.

## Native projects (CNG)

`android/` and `ios/` are **gitignored prebuild output** — never hand-edit them.
All native config lives in `app.json` + `expo-build-properties`. Regenerate with
`npx expo prebuild --clean`.
